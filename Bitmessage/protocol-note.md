### Message Encodings
|value(name)|description|
|-----------|-----------|
|0(IGNORE)  |Any data with this number may be **ignored**. The **sending node** might simply be **sharing its public key with you**.|
|1(TRIVIAL) |UTF-8. No 'Subject' or 'Body' sections. Useful for **simple strings** of data, like **URIs or magnet links**.|
|2(SIMPLE)  |UTF-8. Uses 'Subject' and 'Body' sections. No MIME is used. **messageToTransmit = 'Subject:' + subject + '\n' + 'Body:' + message**|
|3(EXTENDED)|A data structure in **msgpack**, then **compressed with zlib**. Null data type is encoded as an empty string, and booleans as an integer 0 (false) or 1 (true). Text fields are encoded using UTF-8. **v5** and newer address versions MUST support this. Proposal, exact structure pending standardisation.|

> Further values for the message encodings can be decided upon by the community. Any MIME or MIME-like encoding format, should they be used, should make use of **Bitmessage's 8-bit bytes**. :question:

### Pubkey bitfield features
|bit(name)              |description|
|-----------------------|-----------|
|0(undefined)           |The most significant bit at the beginning of the structure. Undefined|

|31(does_ack)           |If **true**, the **receiving node** does **send acknowledgements** (rather than dropping them).|

## Message types
> Undefined messages received on the wire must be ignored.

### version
> When a node creates an **outgoing connection**, it will immediately advertise its version. The remote node will respond with its version. No futher communication is possible until both peers have **exchanged their version**

#### payload
|description(size, data type)|comments    |
|----------------------------|------------|
|version(4, int32_t)         |(=) **protocol version** being used by the node. Should equal **3**. Nodes should disconnect if the remote node's version is lower but continue with the connection if it is higher.|
|services(8, uint64_t)       |**bitfield of features** to be enabled for this connection|
|timestamp(8, int64_t)       |standard UNIX timestamp in **seconds**|
|addr_recv(26, net_addr)     |The network address of the node receiving this message (**not including the time or stream number**)|
|addr_from(26, net_addr)     |The network address of the node emitting this message (**not including the time or stream number** and the **ip itself** is **ignored** by the receiver)|

|stream_numbers(1+, var_int_list)|The stream numbers that the emitting node is **interested in**. Sending nodes must ! include > 160000 stream numbers.|

> **A "verack" packet shall be sent if the version packet was accepted.** Once you have sent and received a verack messages with the remote node, send an **addr message advertising up to 1000 peers of which you are aware**, and **one or more inv messages advertising all of the valid objects of which you are aware**.

#### The following services are currently assigned:
|value(name)    |description|
|---------------|-----------|
|1(NODE_NETWORK)|This is a normal network node.|
|2(NODE_SSL)    |This node supports **SSL/TLS** in the current connect (python < 2.7.9 only supports a SSL client, so in that case it would only have this on when the connection is a client).|

### verack
> The verack message is sent in reply to version. This message consists of only **a message header with the command string "verack"**. **The TCP timeout** starts out at 20 seconds; after verack messages are exchanged, the timeout is raised to 10 minutes.
>
> If both sides announce that they **support SSL**, they MUST perform **a SSL handshake immediately after they both send and receive verack**. During this SSL handshake, the TCP client acts as a SSL client, and the TCP server acts as a SSL server. The current implementation (**v0.5.4 or later**) requires the **AECDH-AES256-SHA cipher over TLSv1 protocol**, and prefers the **secp256k1 curve** (but other curves may be accepted, depending on the version of python and OpenSSL used).

### addr
> Provide information on **known nodes** of the network. Non-advertised nodes should be forgotten after typically **3 hours**

#### Payload:

|----------------------------|------------|
|count(?, var_int)           |Number of inventory entries|
|inventory(32x?, inv_vect[]) |**Inventory vectors**|

### object
> An object is **a message which is shared throughout a stream**. It is the only message which propagates; **all others are only between two nodes**. Objects **have a type, like 'msg', or 'broadcast'**. **To be a valid object, the POW must be done.** :exclamation: The maximum allowable length of an object (**!~-~ the objectPayload**) is **218 bytes**.

|description(size, data type)|comments    |
|----------------------------|------------|
|nonce(8, uint64_t)          |**Random nonce** used for the POW|
|expiresTime(8, uint64_t)    |The "end of life" time of this object (be aware, in version 2 of the protocol this was the generation time). Objects shall be shared with peers until its end-of-life time has been reached. **The node should store the inventory vector of that object for some extra period of time** to avoid reloading it from another node with a small time delay. The time may be **no further than 28 days + 3 hours in the future**.|
|objectType(4, uint32_t)     |Four values are currently defined: **0-"getpubkey", 1-"pubkey", 2-"msg", 3-"broadcast"**. All other values are reserved. Nodes **should relay** objects even if they use an **undefined object type**.|
|version(1+, var_int)        |**The object's version**. Note that msg objects won't contain a version until Sun, 16 Nov 2014 22:00:00 GMT.|
|stream number(1+, var_int)  |**The stream number in which this object may propagate**|
|objectPayload(?, uchar[])   |This field **varies depending on the object type**; see below.|

## Object types
> Here are the **payloads** for various object types.

### getpubkey
> When a node **has the hash of a public key (from an address) but not the public key itself**, it must send out a request for the public key.

|description(size, data type)|comments    |
|----------------------------|------------|
|ripe(20, uchar[])           |The **ripemd hash of the public key**. This field is only included when the **address version is <= 3**.|
|tag(32, uchar[])            |The tag **derived from the address version, stream number, and ripe**. This field is only included when the **address version is >= 4**.|

### pubkey

|public signing key(64, uchar[])   |The **ECC** public key used for **signing** (**uncompressed** format; normally **prepended with \x04**)|
|public encryption key(64, uchar[])|The **ECC** public key used for **encryption** (uncompressed format; normally prepended with \x04 )|
|nonce_trials_per_byte(1+, var_int)|Used to **calculate the difficulty target of messages accepted by this node**. higher => more difficult the POW before this individual will accept the message. This number is the **average number of nonce trials a node** will have to perform to **meet** the POW requirement. **1000** is the network minimum so any lower values will be automatically raised to 1000.|
|extra_bytes(1+, var_int)          |Used to **calculate the difficulty target of messages accepted by this node**. higher => more difficult the POW before this individual will accept the message. This number is **added to the data length to make sending small messages more difficult**. **1000** is the network minimum so any lower values will be automatically raised to 1000.  |
|sig_length(1+, var_int)           |Length of the signature|
|signature(sig_length, uchar[])    |The **ECDSA** signature which, as of protocol v3, covers the object header starting with the time, appended with the data described in this table down to the extra_bytes. :exclamation:|

#### A version 4 pubkey
|description(size, data type)      |comments    |
|----------------------------------|------------|
|tag(32, uchar[])                  |The tag made up of bytes **32-64** of the **double hash** of the **address data** (see example python code below).|
|encrypted(?, uchar[])             |**Encrypted pubkey data.**|

> When version 4 pubkeys are created, most of the data in the pubkey is encrypted. This is done in such a way that **only someone who has the Bitmessage address which corresponds to a pubkey can decrypt and use that pubkey.** :exclamation: This prevents people from gathering pubkeys sent around the network and using the data from them to create messages to be used in spam or in flooding attacks.
>
> In order to encrypt the pubkey data, **a double SHA-512 hash** is calculated from **the address version number, stream number, and ripe hash of the Bitmessage address that the pubkey corresponds to**. The **first 32 bytes** of this hash are used to create a public and private key pair with which to encrypt and decrypt the pubkey data, using the same algorithm as message encryption (see Encryption). The **remaining 32 bytes** of this hash are added to the **unencrypted** part of the pubkey and used as a **tag**, as above. This allows nodes to determine which pubkey to decrypt when they wish to send a message.
>
> In PyBitmessage, the double hash of the address data is calculated using the python code below:
> **doubleHashOfAddressData = hashlib.sha512(hashlib.sha512(encodeVarint(addressVersionNumber) + encodeVarint(streamNumber) + hash).digest()).digest()**

#### Encrypted data in version 4 pubkeys: :question:

|----------------------------------|------------|
|signature(sig_length, uchar[])    |The **ECDSA** signature which covers everything from the object header starting with the time, then appended with the **decrypted data** down to the extra_bytes. **This was changed in protocol v3.** :exclamation:|

|----------------------------------|------------|
|encrypted(?, uchar[])             |**Encrypted data**. See Encrypted payload. See also Unencrypted Message Data Format|

### broadcast :question:
> Users who are subscribed to the sending address will see the message appear in their inbox. Broadcasts are **version 4 or 5** :exclamation:.
>
> Pubkey objects and **v5** broadcast objects are encrypted the same way: The data encoded in the **sender's Bitmessage address is hashed twice**. The **first 32 bytes** of the resulting hash constitutes the **"private" encryption key** and the **last 32 bytes** constitute a **tag** so that anyone **listening** can easily decide if this particular message is interesting. The sender calculates the public key from the private key and then **encrypts the object with this public key** :exclamation:. Thus anyone who knows the Bitmessage address of the sender of a broadcast or pubkey object can decrypt it.
>
> The version of broadcast objects was previously 2 or 3 but was **changed to 4 or 5 for protocol v3** :exclamation:. Having a broadcast version of **5** indicates that a tag is used which, in turn, is used when the **sender's address version is >=4**.
